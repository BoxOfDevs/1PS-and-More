# 1PS-and-More
One Player Sleep system and Death Counter Scoreboard addon for Minecraft Bedrock

This includes any utilities that include the Player.Json file; other uses may be added in the future.

## Warning
This is not updated to 1.20, where the Player Sleep Percentage gamerule was added. You will have to set that percentage to 1 to get the 1 player sleeping effect. You're still free to use this addon, but it'll need to be combined with that gamerule.
The functions in this addon will be adjusted to accomodate this new gamerule soon.
